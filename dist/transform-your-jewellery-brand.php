                     <hr style="border-top: 2px solid #eb1c24; width: 150px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;">
                     <p>It’s true that this month the price of gold has dipped substantially after the Shanghai Gold Exchange began trading expansively. However, customers in Tamil Nadu region are rejoicing and cashing in on the “Aadi” discounts making this occasion as a   once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in the precious metal. But, people have been quick buying gold coins over jewellery.</p>
                     <p>
                         As a Jeweler, it’s now high time for you to promote your products in different advertising mediums showcasing your product’s unique selling proposition, the design, the cuts and your company. We say this because a recent survey by World Gold Council across the globe suggest that, it’s necessary to promote jewellery during peak sales of gold coins as it shows an interest among consumers to buy gold. 
                     </p>
                     <p>It’s the sole responsibility of the business head to make an investment decision at the right time to change the tide from gold coins to jewellery. Similar clearance season happens in other countries during Christmas primarily. Astey Clarke – a well-known Jewelry company from UK quotes that,” Our customers get attracted to our products in this season only when we clearly communicate about the price discount effectively without any biased info. Therefore, the advertisement’s needs to communicate only a single message to boost sales.”</p>
